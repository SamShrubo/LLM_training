# LLM_training

Building the dataset for the training corpus using specs from open-source RISC-V processors

TODO:
- break down files over 20k characters
- do verilog files for each data chunk
- 

Notes:
- I have begun by itemizing specific Verilog/SystemVerilog code, ISAs, and cores vs SoC, should I just include the whole specification files on Git Hub or just the Verilog code? i.e. the Python scripts for testing, simulation files, etc.
- How big should my text chunks be when parsing the files into a .json format? Should I divide it by file or segment the files?
