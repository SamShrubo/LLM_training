The processor datapath and control units are designed for Arithmetic and Logical instructions (all r-type instructions + addi, andi, ori, slti), Data transfer instructions (lw, sw), Branch and jump instructions (beq, j). Forwarding control, hazard detection and stalling units are also implemented to improve the efficiency of the pipeline. The designed processor can be tested by initializing the instruction memory with test instructions and obtaining the corresponding register contents by generating waveforms on ModelSim.
